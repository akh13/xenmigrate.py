# xenmigrate.py

This file is used to convert between XenServer .xva files and opensource Xen .img files. The old script (graciously by Jolokia Networks)
and provided by https://github.com/hswayne77 seems out of date and does not run. Instead, when used from the prompt a an error will
be displayed:

"UnboundLocalError: local variable 'source' referenced before assignment"

Script was slightly modified by me to fix this.
